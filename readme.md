## Classification

- You might wanna read the [intro to ML](https://gist.github.com/elsheikh21/cd1d2ba99552ac63763765853840fd61), if you are starting to explore this realm of machine learning.

Is a supervised learning, in which the machine tries to learn from the given dataset and this learning to classify new observations.

1. Binary Classification: distinguishing between female and male, dog and cat, [malware-analysis](https://github.com/elsheikh21/malware-analysis), classify 2 distinct classes, in short.

2. Multi-class Classification: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, bio metric identification, [boats classification](https://github.com/elsheikh21/venice-boats-classification)

### What are types of classification algorithms?

1. Linear Classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Decision Trees
4. Boosted Trees
5. Random Forest (ensemble learning method)
6. Neural Networks
7. Nearest Neighbor (k-nearest-neighbors)
